## üì¶ How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanishqSugandhi/C_Development_Intern 
   cd C_Development_interm
Compile a file

bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
For programs requiring additional files, make sure all source files are in the same directory before compiling.
